# Help Desk / Ticketing System

## Overview
This app is a help desk / ticketing system that is use to create cases that will be assigned to an administrative user that responds and resolves the case. The case status can be updated and comments are added so that users can keep track of their cases. Once the case is resolved users can leave a survey with a comment and rating.

Administrators have access to all cases and the ability to assign cases. They also can mangage users and view all surveys to keep track of how users are rating the quality of case resolution.
